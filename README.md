# Basketball Player Detection

 This project is about tracking basketball players in the images during different games or warm-ups. They can also be detected during their personal life. That can show the difficult life of every basketball player, for example. Or how they are dealing with the NBA community. But usually it will show how they are playing because his is the main fact in which every basketball player is intersted in.

[this is the first image that will be using by the detection script](<a href="https://imgur.com/QoVrUWg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QoVrUWg.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>)

## The Algorithm

My algorithm will work pretty simple. It will take some basketball images as an input and than my script will detect labeled objects which I labeled. For example, I have a label named "basketball player" or "basketball rim". So I made a rectangular boxes which the script will analyse.

## Running this project

1. I added some images to that repository, but if you want, you can always add some. 
2. So in fact, I have three things in my github repository. The "readme.md" file in which you can always read all the information. I have my code and folder with the images that I included earlier.
